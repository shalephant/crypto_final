Signature Verification Process:

1. When Alice signs the message, GPG creates a SHA-256 hash of the content.
2. This hash is encrypted with Alice's private key → forms the digital signature.
3. Upon receipt, Bob:
   - Decrypts the signature using Alice's public key.
   - Computes the hash of the received message.
   - Compares it with the decrypted hash.
4. If they match, the signature is valid.

This ensures:
- Authenticity: Only Alice could have signed it.
- Integrity: Message wasn't altered.
- Non-repudiation: Alice cannot deny sending it.

GPG outputs:
"Good signature from Alice" → verification successful.
